          BlockCoin aims to reshape the United States rare coin market
          by bridging the gap between technology and traditional rare coin collecting.
          For the first time in history, investors around the globe
          can gain true fractionalized ownership of Pre-1933 United States minted collectible coins.
          This game-changing paradigm shift is led by the evolution of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
          This shift will allow for the decentralization of traditional practices
          of collecting, investing, ownership, and enjoyment of rare collectible coins.

            Before digital minting, each physical, collectible coin is professionally graded
            by PCGS (Professional Coin Grading Service) or NGC (Numismatic Guaranty Corp),
            the top grading services. The physical, collectible coin is then put into custody with Dillon Gage,
            a trusted third party that has served major financial institutions and banks for over 40 years.
            The coins remain in custody with the insured depository, securely stored in a vault, and audited weekly.
            The NFTs can be traded and sold in the open secondary markets,
            but each NFT will retain fractional ownership of the physical coin held independently by the depository.
